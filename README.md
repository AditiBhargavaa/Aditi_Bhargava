This code is just for refence purpose. 
I have written these codes for a capstone project during my certification. It is a social media data which contained columns like user_id, username, user_post, tag_name, tag_count, photo_tag, tag_id, photo_id and photo_count.
It has analyzed the heads mentioned below- 
1)	How many times does the average user post?
2)	Find the top 5 most used hashtags
3)	Find users who have liked every single photo on the site.
4)	Retrieve a list of users along with their usernames and the rank of their account creation, ordered by the creation date in ascending order.
5)	List the comments made on photos with their comment texts, photo URLs, and usernames of users who posted the comments. Include the comment count for each photo
6)	For each tag, show the tag name and the number of photos associated with that tag. Rank the tags by the number of photos in descending order.
7)	List the usernames of users who have posted photos along with the count of photos they have posted. Rank them by the number of photos in descending order.
8)	Display the username of each user along with the creation date of their first posted photo and the creation date of their next posted photo.
9)	For each comment, show the comment text, the username of the commenter, and the comment text of the previous comment made on the same photo.
